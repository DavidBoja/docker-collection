# Docker collection

![docker-collection-banner-image](docker_collection.png)

Collection of Dockerfiles for existing projects/papers I tested â€” useful as a starting point for your own experiments. Adapt the Dockerfiles and running scripts to your needs.

# Instructions

Each project/paper implementation consists of 3 files:
- Dockerfile
- build.sh
- run.sh

and optional additional files (such as python requirements.txt or conda environemnts.yml files). 

The idea is to build the docker image from the Dockerfile using `build.sh` and run the docker container using `run.sh`. For a project `SELECTED-PROJECT` run the following:

```
cd SELECTED-PROJECT
sh build.sh
sh run.sh CODE-PATH DATA-PATH
```
where `CODE-PATH` is the path to the code from the original GitHub repository, and `DATA-PATH` is the path to the datasets location you want to use in the docker container.

# Implementations

The implmemented projects/papers are listed in the table below. The files for a selected project are located in `dockers/<Location>`, where `<Location>` is listed in the table.
